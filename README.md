# arduiono-piezo-drums
Arduino-based piezo-electric sensor signal pick up, to use it as an electronic drum set. The code discriminates peaks between 5 piezo sensors (hits) and sends them as separate MIDI notes. Angus Gratton's Hairless MidiSerial is the software I use to convert the serial input to a useful MIDI output.
